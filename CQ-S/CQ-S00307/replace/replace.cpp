It's so bad that I can't get the CSP-S prize.
My five years with C++ was long but also short ,
I havn't anything with prize.It's a bad story.
My fist time to take a part in CSP is in 2024 , but I didn't
pass the first competiton.
Now , I'm passing the first competition( not only J , nut also S)
and writing my own daima.But tigao'zu is so difficult that
I can't understand the meaning so I give up.
All in all,my grammar is not good.I really enjoy my
five years with C++ ...... The end;.
