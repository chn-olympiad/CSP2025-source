Anyway.
So now I have to try and kill my time. 
but I have no idea of what I can do now.
so I should write a letter to CCF to
ask it for advice.
Heres the letter:
    
	Dear CCF,
     How are you?(Im fine thank you very much.)
    you see,I have a teeny weeny problem here.
    it is that I couldnt work out any of the 4 problems
	in the competition(CSP-S,to be exact) you hosted.
	
	because of this,Id feel seriously depressed and hurt.
	so could you please send an email to Alan Turing and tell him to order
	me a 523kg heavy monument of him? 
	(mailed to my house.)
	itd probably make me feel a lot better,thks.
		BTW the address is 
		TotalPerspectiveVortex,FrogStar_B
	
	Also, my back is having a revolution against me due to the 
	curve of the metal back of seat, which doesnt really 
	fit my spine.How can I evolute my spine into the curve of my chair
	in 10 minutes? Im actually quite wanting to grow a spine
	that streches out instead of in so that it can have some fresh air.
	Im pretty worried that my spine would have depression if it doesnt get
	any sunshine.
	
	....And another thing. Do you have any datas about
	the portion of time OIers spend on video games? D be useful 
 	since Im trying to persuade my teachers to cacel all the schooldays
	to lengthen my game time,which is now far below 0.
	and canceling the homework is also good for my mental health
	because I now have two dozen pages of Chinese homework left
	to finish and its just one week till the mid-term exams
	and this all is making me get(not lost) my marbles.
	
	and you know what, the guys around are all typing real fast and ferocious
	so I guess some sort of demon bewitched my lunch.
	I ate all of my lunch so now Im having haullcions(see,I dont even know what the word should look like)  
	and seeing problems with my feet.
	
	So long and thanks for all the rps.I think I should donate some so my classmates
	can acheive better scores, although theyd be more likely to be negatively affected
	since I got triple worsts on luogu.
	
	Anyway I think Im sulfur(and indeed I am) thats being dipped into oxygen
	cause if you look closely you will see blue and purple fire on my head.
	
	maybe I should do some little bit of redemption to make up for my bad luck
	so I shouldnt lie and tell you that Im making this passage up.Im a sinner who
	tells lots of gossips so Im never gossiping about anybody in my class.but,notice 
	that 5*3/3*7/and many others arent really gossips.theyre real.since we must spread  
	truth to mankind, we should do our best to make those world famous, so could you do one last favor,
	and put my letter on Weird Answers Of GD-Candidates section thank you so much 
																			yours, 
																			    SR
																				  
How great.Ive managed to spend 90 minutes on this and successfully stayed alive up till now,
18:17 (hurray!) now I can finally half-heartedly focuse on my whk (obviously Im gonna drown myself in the game
Rain World this evening).
Im really looking forward to reading some 25trip-overlook on luogu
hope my csp-j aint nofink.
