	//Well,Why don't I write program?Something pity happened on this CSP-S competition.
	//When The exam start.I read the problems.But I found that the Problem 1 is a little difficult for me.
	//I first try to use DFS,but the algorithm is O(3^N).It is too large.
	//Then,I try to use DP.But when I have seen the result of the DP solution,oh no!The answer is wrong.
	//So,if I use the DFS solution,I can get 20pts.If I use the DP solution,I can't get any score.
	//when I think about this,There was only 1 hour left.
	//I quickly read the Problem 2.But I couldn't found any solution.
	//I was bored that time.I found a folder named "^_^" on the desktop.
	//I clicked it without doubt,and then clicked the file "æØ æ∫Û»À.bat" at once.
	//Something surprising happen.Too many cmd window was created.Then my computer screen get black.
	//I found the teacher and repawn the computer.It took me 5 minutes.I want to *** the student who created the folder.
	//Now there is only 2 minutes left.I can't come up with an idea of solving the Problem 3 and Problem 4.
	//I can only tell what happened just now.
	//I don't want any rewards now. I hope I can get the only 20 pts.
	//I make a wish here.I hope that everyone who takes part in the CSP-S can get good grades
