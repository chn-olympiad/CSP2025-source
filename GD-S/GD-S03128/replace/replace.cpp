/*
Darkest night I'll confront you here.

Such a desitiny was not desired
In this place
I'll never wish to see that
Side of you
And raise
Different colors for one another
Never nothice me
Never call my name with your vioce

Let me forget everything
And leave no trace of you
What am I carrying
Out on this horizons of despair
If does not you
I can hurt anyone in the name of justice
Your shadow gets in the way of my light
And testify

Let me forget everything
Still the moonlight shines on us
Broken heart
I don't want you
To find and take a look at
So I'll sin more and destroy my thoughts
Make a mess of my hand
I swear on 
The darkest night I'll end it all
And testify

All that I'm left
With is your reminiscenes
Take me to where you are
Won't you
Till then I'll keep struggling
Cause of justice you don't know
