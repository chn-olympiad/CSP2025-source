Today is very ordinary...
But my OI career is ending. From 7 grade to 11 grade, it is enough.
At the first time, I was excited cuz I can play computer in school.
That time, I way using Python and took part in Lanqiao and
get Province 1= national 2=. It was a delight time.
Later, in order to took part in the csp & noip, I was asked to use
cpp. Cpp is harder than py, but i try my best. After graduation from
junior high, I went to Goangdong Guangya High School, it was great.
And I was addicted in Linux..., I installed a Kubuntu in my portable hard disk
and a win11 as well. So I could use Wechat, QQ, and so on in school.
Day by day, I was grade 11, it's time for me to retire from OI, I was a little sad,
now is my last competition, after csp, i would be back to school studying.
Perhaps i will only get 2= or even 3= this time, it is enough.
I miss my OI friends, such as ZhaoYuFei, WuZiJun, QuanZhiHeng, HeRuiXuan, ZengZhiJie, WenHongYi and so on.
And my teacher YangJian and ZhengZiCong. Also, XieLuoDi.
I dont know whether my teachers would download the source code and review, but i would 
go on writing.
Now it is UTC + 08:00 11:45, I think I was fortune to have such comfortable environment
and devices and friends. After Retiring, i think my exam grade would rise a lot.
However, I will go on learning cpp and python in the future. They are useful and helpful

Good luck to see this.
Bye you, bye my OI career.

Thanks Zeng, Chen, Zhang, Quan, Feng, Ou,  Hui.
