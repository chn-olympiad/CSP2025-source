I wear a mask with a smile for hours at a time.
Saring at the ceiling while I hold back what's on my mind?
And when they ask me how I'm doing?
I say "I'm just fine".
And when they ask me how I'm doing?
I say "I'm just fine".
-------------------------------
But the fact is.
I can never get off of my materrs.
And all that they can ask is.
Why are you so sad kid?
That's what's the mask is.
That's what's the points of the mask is.
----------------------------
So you can see I'm trying.
You won't see me crying.
I'll just keep on smiling.I'm good.(Yeah I'm good)
And it just keeps on peiling.
It's so terryfeying.
But I keep on smiling.I'm good.(Yeah I'm good)
------------------------------
I've been caring too much for so long.
Been compering myself for so long.
Been wearing a smile for so long it's real.
For so long it's real.So long it's real.
-------------------------------
Always being judged by a bunch of strong faces.
Scared to go outside haven't seen the light in ages.
But I've been places.
So I'm okay-ish.So I'm okay-ish.
Yeah I'm okay.Wait!!!
------------------------------
But the fact is.
I need help I falling all my classes.
They think that I need glasses.
I just really wish that I could pass this.
That's what's the mask is.
That's what's the points of the mask is.
