At 17:36, I had a rest for around 10 mins, not knowing what to do next.
it seems that i have gotten 200pts, but i couldn't ensure that i could get the first prize or i TRULY get 200pts.
but i couldn't contain my excitement now as it is the first time that i have solved S-T2.
By 17:46, My thought has been wandering for another 10 mins.
but i found that partical points of problem D seems easier than that of problem C.
