What can I say?
Maybe, this is my last CSP.
As a loser of OI,
My grades always bad.
Including test in our school and csp
My first csp lasted on 23'
Actually, I tried csp on 22', but I didn't pass the first test that time.
Also, in csp-j2023, I couldn't even pass "the little apple", and I got 10, only 10.
Then, I learned and worked not so hard.
On 24', I got the 1st prize of csp-j, but csp-j2024 is the "waterest" test around these years.
And then, I still work not so hard.
But in this summer vacation, I realized the pleasure of learning OI.
Then, I worked so hard.
But it's too late......
Today, I only got about 164, what a bad grade.
Wish I can visit NOIp, It's my dream.
I hope my OI's tour can have a good ending.
Hope somebody can look this and decrease score line.
Thx.=)
