    Do you hear the people sing
    Singing the song of angry men
    It is the music of a people
    Who will not be slaves again
    When the beating of your heart
    Echoes the beating of the drums
    There is a life about to start
    When tomorrow comes

    Will you join in our crusade
    Who will be strong and stand with me
    Beyond the barricade is there
    A world you long to see
    So join in the fight that will
    Give you the right to be free

    Do you hear the people sing
    Singing the song of angry men
    It is the music of a people
    Who will not be slaves again
    When the beating of your heart
    Echoes the beating of the drums
    There is a life about to start
    When tomorrow comes

    Will you give all you can give
    So that our banner can advance
    Some will fall and some will live
    So will you take your chance?
    The blood of the martyrs will
    shine the light of hope's glance

    Do you hear the people sing
    Singing the song of angry men
    It is the music of a people
    Who will not be slaves again
    When the beating of your heart
    Echoes the beating of the drums
    There is a life about to start
    When tomorrow comes
