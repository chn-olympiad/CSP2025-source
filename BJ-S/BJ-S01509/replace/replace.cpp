// This is an essay written in the last 5 minutes
// I want to kill my self.
// I expect to get 176 or 181 points in this exam to get 1=
// But if I get 0 points in T1 or T2 I will AFO.
// I learned coding for 4 years, from Grade 5 to Grade 8, this is my forth time to attend CSP tests.
// My teacher and parents expected me to get NOIP 1= this year.
// And I just get 176 points in CSP-S??? Even less than 200? That's too ridiculous
