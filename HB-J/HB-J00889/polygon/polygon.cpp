/*
terrible fight,my confidence breaks.
no need for another try
I force to think,about the faraway past
how did I begin?
I had had the eager
when I was younger
my life was bright
my father gave me guide
to the broad coding land
surely I loved game
colorful and fine
I went ahead a few years ago
the dream was born in light
the expert I would be

but wed changes so fast
no one can think twice
I lost my former eager
got into charming sites
less time I spent
they were put into rest
some boring , pointless thing

yet I have change to wake
but I forget to choose
this is my third time
I sit before computer
thinking about these thing

if the start is wrong,
what if this is true
time will never be back then
I can't choose again
I believe that's fate
but what it will help
chances fade away
I want to touch it
at last reach nothing

this is my road
I feel the failure
the road becomes two halves
a sound tells me
'look at what you did!'
'you destroyed it yourself!'
'you are getting to the end'
'what you want to leave?'
I watch despair,asking the sound
'can't I save myself'
'or it's too late'
sound replies
'so why do you write this?'
'you need to answer yourself'
yes,I have no reason to write these thing
'so what can I do?'
'stop doing this'
'and check your code'
'after all it's better than waiting'
'a man can't give up hope'
'go on,you will'

I pick up my thoughts
maybe it's right
I
should be sure

It nearly ends
I can't say much
I do things I should do
farewell,this time
I don't know if I can come back here
it takes a lot
but I get able to face my mind
however,the weather is fine
I can't say that I'm under the weather
so I let my soul out
these is the last words
no,don't misunderstand
I just feel a little bad
my eye hurts
I need a nap or something
afternoon there is another
so I should not think too much
I can make me a better one
everyone can,as well as me

the boy next to me appears excellent
he always types,all of the time
though I don't know what he inputs
he is younger than me
so you can't judge a person by his age
I'd like to be him
swim in coding sea
how relaxed
but I can't
hits of keys circle around my ears
but I can't
no matter how weak a man is ,he will leave something at last
I choose to leave my words
not to let others see
I'm about to go
towards a new path
in the desert field
