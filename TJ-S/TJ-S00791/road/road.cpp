/*Ok,fine.I still have something to say.
I haven't learnt c++ for many years.So infact I never think about that I can pass the first test of S.
I do hope that I will get only about 10 or less.
But I still come to this test,even we have to pay for it(a lot).
I don't think that means I'm a doll.(Ok,just a bit)
I come here because I have to have this test next year.
My family and my teacher said it's good for the test next year.
I wish it will work and I can get a nice return(I don't know that can I use "return" here or not.) in the J this year and S next year.
In the end I have to say:
"7199"
Ok,again.
