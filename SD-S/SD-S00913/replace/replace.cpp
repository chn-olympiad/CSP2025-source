/*
The sky is getting darker, there is only tapping keyboard sounds. 
There is water on my face, I don't know if it is sweat or tears. 
Oh, it looks like I'm going to dye here. 
I think I can only get 25+16+0+0.
It's my first CSP-S, why is it so hard?! (2025.11.1 18:07)

Please give me some pts, please.
